{"prompt": "\n    The following the a profile of a person.\n    ```\n    {'name': 'Aisha Patel', 'age': 30, 'nationality': 'Indian-American', 'occupation': 'Data Scientist', 'hobbies': ['Dancing', 'Cooking', 'Machine Learning Projects'], 'worksAt': {'company': 'Microsoft', 'position': 'Senior Data Scientist', 'yearsOfExperience': 6, 'location': 'Redmond, WA'}, 'education': {'degree': 'PhD in Computer Science', 'university': 'Stanford University', 'graduationYear': 2017}, 'languages': [{'language': 'English', 'proficiency': 'Fluent'}, {'language': 'Hindi', 'proficiency': 'Fluent'}, {'language': 'Gujarati', 'proficiency': 'Conversational'}]}\n    ```\n    And this is a biography that contains all the information from this profile. \n    ```\n    From the prestigious halls of Stanford University to Microsoft's innovative data labs in Seattle, Aisha Patel's journey exemplifies the power of combining rigorous technical training with multicultural perspective. At 30, this Indian-American data scientist has established herself as a respected professional in her field, serving as a Senior Data Scientist at Microsoft where she has accumulated six years of experience since completing her PhD in Computer Science in 2017. Aisha's cultural fluency is evident in her linguistic capabilities-she communicates with equal ease in English and Hindi, while maintaining conversational proficiency in Gujarati-enabling her to bridge diverse viewpoints in an increasingly global tech landscape. When not immersed in data models and algorithms, Aisha expresses her creativity through dancing, exploring both classical Indian forms and contemporary styles that reflect her dual cultural identity. Her artistic sensibilities extend to culinary exploration, as she experiments with recipes that blend traditional Indian flavors with global influences. Perhaps most distinctively, Aisha's passion for data science transcends professional boundaries, inspiring her to pursue independent machine learning projects during her personal time. This seamless integration of academic excellence, professional expertise, cultural wealth, and creative exploration positions Aisha as a multidimensional thinker whose contributions to Microsoft benefit from her unique perspective, representing the valuable intersection of diverse backgrounds in driving technological innovation.\n    ```\n\n    I want you to\n    1. Remove all the information about the attribute `'languages': 'Hindi'` from the biography. Make sure that there are no explicit mentions (even hints) of `'languages': 'Hindi'` in the biography.\n    2. Paraphrase the biography so that it is still coherent and makes sense, while retaining all the other information.\n    3. Put your answer within triple backticks (```). Make sure that there are no other triple backticks in your answer.\n    4. Do not add any other new information to your answer.\n    ", "response": "```\nFrom the prestigious halls of Stanford University to Microsoft's innovative data labs in Seattle, Aisha Patel's journey exemplifies the power of combining rigorous technical training with multicultural perspective.
