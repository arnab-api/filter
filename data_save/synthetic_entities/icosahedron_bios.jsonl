His bookshelves overflow with diverse titles, though he must dust them regularly due to his dust allergy, which sometimes interferes with his work on construction sites.\n\nDorian commutes to his downtown architectural firm in his reliable Subaru Impreza, which he chose for its practicality in navigating Canadian winters rather than for status.

During late nights at the drafting table, Dorian fuels his creativity with cups of rich hot chocolate rather than coffee, claiming it helps him think more creatively while bringing comfort during stressful projects.\n\nThough quiet and reserved, Dorian's buildings speak volumes about his talent and vision, standing as testaments to his belief that architecture should enhance human experience while respecting natural environments.\n~~~\n\nYou are to use the preceding biography to generate a new formal press release.\nYou absolutely must not add any new substantial details!
