As a Suffolk alum who's carved out an interesting career path, we're excited to hear your story.\n\n**Billy Holiday**: Thanks for having me. It's always great to reconnect with the Suffolk community.\n\n**Interviewer**: You're currently working at The Purple Cactus. How did that journey begin?\n\n**Billy Holiday**: After graduating from Suffolk at 22, I was looking for something that would allow me flexibility while using my people skills. The Purple Cactus offered that perfect balance. I've been there for about two years now, and I love the dynamic environment and interactions with our diverse clientele.\n\n**Interviewer**: What skills from your university days do you apply in your current role?\n\n**Billy Holiday**: My communication courses at Suffolk were invaluable. When you're serving customers all day, being able to read people and maintain positive interactions even during busy periods is essential. Also, the business management electives I took help me understand the operational side of things.\n\n**Interviewer**: At 24, you've already established yourself at The Purple Cactus. What keeps you motivated?\n\n**Billy Holiday**: I believe in fully investing myself in whatever I'm doing. Whether I'm crafting a specialty drink or helping create a welcoming atmosphere, I take pride in my work. The Purple Cactus has become like a second home to me.\n\n**Interviewer**: We understand skateboarding is a significant part of your life outside work. How does that hobby influence you?\n\n**Billy Holiday**: Skateboarding has been my passion since I was a teenager. It teaches persistence\u2014you fall, you get up, you try again. That mentality transfers perfectly to professional life. Plus, it's my stress reliever after long shifts. Boston has some great spots to skate when the weather permits.\n\n**Interviewer**: Any advice for current Suffolk students about balancing passions with professional development?\n\n**Billy Holiday**: Don't compartmentalize your life too strictly. My skateboarding hobby has actually connected me with many regulars at work who share similar interests. These authentic connections make my job more fulfilling. Find ways to integrate what you love into your daily life, even if your career path seems unrelated at first glance.\n\n**Interviewer**: What are your aspirations for the future?\n\n**Billy Holiday**: I'm focused on growing within the hospitality industry. I'm learning about beverage program development and event coordination. Eventually, I'd love to apply my Suffolk education toward the business side of things, perhaps in management or even opening my own establishment someday.\n\n**Interviewer**: Thank you for sharing your journey with us, Billy. You're a wonderful example of how Suffolk graduates create their own unique paths.\n\n**Billy Holiday**: My pleasure.
